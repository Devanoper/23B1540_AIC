* In the failed file , I tried multi-bboxes and multi-class labels , but couldn't make the custom loss function properly
* In the normal file , I have simplified the task to only detect labels in images with one object

  NOTE: For some reason these files are refusing to show properly in github , you may need to download them to view properly
