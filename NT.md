# Q1
## Leveraging AI to Predict Student Academic Performance at IIT

## Project Timeline (1 Month)
Ethical NOTE :) : All the data can be anynymous 
### **Week 1: Understanding & Data**

* **Task 1: Define the Problem**
  * **Target:** Student GPA (measure of academic performance)
  * **Predictors:**
  * Attendance (number of classes attended)
  * Participation (activity in online forums)
  * Course Difficulty (average GPA of past students)
  * Academic Background (previous exam scores)
  * Personal Factors (interests, extracurricular activities, mentorship)
  * **Baseline:** Simple linear regression model for comparison.

* **Task 2: Gather & Prepare Data**
  * **Data Sources:**
  * IIT Student Management Systems (grades, attendance, enrollment)
  * Online Forums (student discussions)
  * Student Feedback Platforms (course reviews)
  * Public Datasets (student performance, demographics)
  * **Data Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, standardize numbers, and encode categories.

* **Task 3: Explore the Data**
  * **Visualizations:** Analyze relationships between features and GPA using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
  * **Feature Engineering:** Combine existing features (e.g., "course difficulty x attendance") to identify patterns.

### **Week 2: Building an Accurate Model**

* **Task 4: Select & Train Models**
  * **Candidate Models:**
  * Linear Regression
  * Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net (for regularization)
  * Decision Trees, Random Forests
  * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
  * Feedforward Neural Networks
  * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  * **Evaluation Metrics:**
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * R-squared
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * **Training:** Split data into training, validation, and testing sets. Tune model parameters.

* **Task 5: Optimize & Improve**
  * **Feature Importance:** Identify which features are most crucial for prediction.
  * **Model Ensemble:** Combine multiple models to improve accuracy.
  * **Cross-Validation:** Evaluate model performance using various data splits.

### **Week 3: Deploying & Presenting**

* **Task 6: Prototype Development**
  * **Web Application:** Create a user-friendly interface for data input and prediction output.

* **Task 7: Test & Refine**
  * **Evaluation on Hold-out Set:** Assess the trained model on unseen data.
  * **Error Analysis:** Identify biases and areas for improvement.
  * **Model Tuning:** Fine-tune parameters and data preprocessing.

* **Task 8: Finalize & Present**
  * **Visualizations:** Create clear graphs and visualizations for the presentation.
  * **Rehearse:** Practice explaining the project effectively.
  * **Documentation:** Document methodology, code, and results.

* **Task 9: Hackathon Day**
  * **Presentation:** Present the project to the judges, highlighting problem, solution, results, and impact.
  * **Demo:** Showcase the web application and API.
  * **Q&A:** Answer questions from the judges.

### **Resources**

* **Cloud Platform:** Utilize cloud computing services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
* **GPU Acceleration:** Use GPU instances for faster model training and inference (especially for deep learning).
* **Software Tools:** Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask).
