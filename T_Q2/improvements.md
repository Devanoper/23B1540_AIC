## What could be improved : 
* Understanding the "Human": Right now, AIs are good at understanding the words, but not the meaning. Like, I can say "I'm feeling blue" and the AI might just be like, "Blue is a color." It doesn't get the emotional vibe
* Get some new architecture to bypass context limit
* AI should be more than just a tool, it should be a companion. AIs can help us with tasks and information, but they can also be a source of entertainment and comfort. We need AIs that can engage us in meaningful conversations, tell us jokes, and even help us learn new things.
