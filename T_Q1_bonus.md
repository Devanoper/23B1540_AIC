# Differences and Advantages of ViTs:
* Global Context: ViTs can capture long-range dependencies and global context within images, something CNNs 
struggle with due to their local receptive fields. This enables them to better understand the relationships between distant image regions, which is
crucial for tasks like object detection and scene understanding.
* Flexibility: ViTs can handle images of varying sizes without the need for resizing or padding, making them more adaptable to different input formats
* Data Efficiency: While CNNs often require massive datasets for optimal performance, ViTs can achieve competitive results with smaller datasets due to their ability to learn from global context.
* Reduced Inductive Bias: ViTs have a weaker inductive bias compared to CNNs, meaning they rely less on predefined assumptions about image structure and more on the data itself. This allows them to adapt to new image domains and learn more complex patterns.
