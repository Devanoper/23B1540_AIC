# Key Differences and Advantages of ViTs:
* Global Context: ViTs can capture long-range dependencies and global context within images, something CNNs 
struggle with due to their local receptive fields. This enables them to better understand the relationships between distant image regions, which is
crucial for tasks like object detection and scene understanding.
